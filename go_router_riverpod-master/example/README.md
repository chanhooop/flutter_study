# Riverpod + GoRouter + Hooks + Freezed

This example covers:
- Riverpod's APIs, including autoDispose, providers, notifiers, keepAliveLink, etc.
- GoRouter's latest APIs
- An authentication model
- An authorization model
- An intermediate splash page
- Some basic persistence API usage
- **!** extensive usage of code generation

**Note**. Tests are missing. I'll try and implement some ASAP.

**Note 2**:
  - _This repo is to be considered a "best effort" example that aims to show how to correctly integrate the above libraries_;
  - _Indeed, we can all agree that there is no magical silver bullet that fits in every possible use case: use this repo with caution._.

## Dependencies and Libs version

Have a look at [pubspec.yaml] to see which versions are being used in here.

## Getting started

Run this.

```
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter pub upgrade && flutter pub run build_runner watch -d
```

And enjoy this example.
